## Software Development Portfolio

My name is Dennis Fisher and I have a Bachelor's of Science from Southern New Hampshire University. Below is a showcase of my capstone work as well as the narratives to offer insight into my thought process on how I worked towards solving problems.

>During the course, we were asked to perform an in-depth code review on our project that we selected for enhancement.

## Software Design and Engineering Enhancement

>For my first artifact, I have been improving my final project from my CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization course. For that course’s final project, I built a table that can be moved around by the user. By using hotkeys, the user could zoom around and move and rotate the table however they pleased. I took this course during the 19EW6 term. 

>I wanted to include this artifact in my ePortfolio as it was an artifact that used a language I haven’t worked with much in the past and I wanted to get some more practice using C++. I was able to implement previous functions and utilize that to create more features that weren’t required for the final project back in the CS 330 course. I improved the artifact as I expanded its complexity and made the overall application more exciting. 

>I met the course I objectives I planned to meet with this enhancement. I was able to use my skills and techniques to implement design solutions and accomplish the goals I set for myself. I set solutions to solve logic problems in my software as well as notice potential design flaws related to security. 

>I took my previous process involving hotkeys and wanted to have the user change the colorations of the table that they see. I originally planned to have the user press either T for table and L for lighting, but soon realized that I was only able to use the F1-12 keys. I was then thinking, instead of just randomly switching colors, I figured, the user should be able to adjust the amount of red, blue and green that was available. That would be more fun and interactive with the user. I did come to realize that if I kept the code is it was, the user could keep adding more of a singular color and could crash the program. I had to implement a max and min feature to the colors so that the color would stop increasing once the max was hit, and stop decreasing when reaching the minimum. I had to be careful not to let the user affect the application that could completely break my project.

## Algorithms and Data Structure

>For my second artifact, I have been improving my final project from my CS 340: Advanced Programming Concepts course. For that course’s final project, we were to create and develop a web service using a software stack and we needed to implement an industry-standard interface. We were to use the RESTful application programming interface (API) web-based protocol and use MongoDB to code and test the uniform resource identifier (URI) paths.  I took this course during the 19EW5 term. 

>I wanted to include this artifact in my ePortfolio as it was an artifact that used a language I never worked with in the past, except for this course. I was able to implement previous functions and utilize them to create more reports that weren’t required for the final project back in the CS 340 course. I improved the artifact as I expanded its complexity.

>I met the course I objectives I planned to meet with this enhancement. I was able to use my skills and techniques to employ iterative testing techniques in my code. I was able to use the software development life cycle to create realistic production schedules for software projects. I was able to create an industry-standard software design. I made sure each function had a clear description if it needed one. I was able to create more robust and efficient code to deliver value and accomplish my industry-specific goals.


## Databases

>For my third artifact, I have been improving my final project from my DAD 220: Introduction to SQL course. For that course’s final project, we were to create a new database from scratch, consisting of multiple tables. We were then to populate the database, update some records, and delete some existing records as well. We were then also creating queries that applied to previous milestones. 

>I wanted to include this artifact in my ePortfolio as it was an artifact that used a language I never worked with in the past, except for this course. I was able to implement previous functions and utilize them to create more reports that weren’t required for the final project back in the DAD 220 course. I improved the artifact as I expanded its complexity cleaned up the code to make it easier to read. I added more advanced concepts in MySQL. I added a couple users and added user security to those users, granting them specific rights.

>I met the course I objectives I planned to meet with this enhancement. I was able to use my skills and techniques to implement design solutions and accomplish the goals I set for myself. I set solutions to solve logic problems in my software as well as notice potential design flaws related to security. I wanted to ensure that the user could easily take my code and understand everything that they were looking at. I made sure each function had a clear description if it needed one.
