## Software Development Portfolio

My name is Dennis Fisher and I have a Bachelor's of Science from Southern New Hampshire University. Below is a showcase of my capstone work as well as the narratives to offer insight into my thought process on how I worked towards solving problems.

## Professional Self-Assessment

>My journey with Computer Science has been a long but enjoyable one. It started for me in my Freshman year of High School. I took every Computer Science that was available and I completely fell in love with the subject. The way it was taught to us, made it even more enjoyable. Starting the year with Visual Basic and Java gave the students the fundamentals to Computer Science that really drew my attention to what we could do in the field. The year after that, we learned more Java as well as C++, broadening our knowledge of languages and what we were able to do. The last two years of High School, we started to learn the more advanced concepts of Computer science as well as develop a game of our own design. I knew then, from my experience in High School, that I loved the field and the people that revolved around it and that I wanted to do that for the rest of my career. 

>When I graduated High School, I immediately signed up for my local community college, Harrisburg Area Community College and I received my Associate’s degree for Computer Science. I took all the Computer Science courses they had that interested me. I then decided I wanted to continue my education at Penn State Harrisburg. I took a bunch of courses there, but the environment was not the best fit for me. The best decision I made was to transfer to Southern New Hampshire University and finish my degree there. I absolutely loved my experience. I had received an Information Technology internship with the local Navy Depot and I was able to better balance my school work with my work for the internship. 

>I found that having both the internship as well as my coursework worked really well together, as I was learning about stuff that would help in both areas. I was learning about topics that would benefit me in my coursework as well as topics that helped in the office. Working in an office, part of a team really helped me in collaborating in a team environment. I had taken courses that was about working in a team, but while it is one thing to work with a team online, it is completely different than working in a team in the office. I found that working in an office setting, you get the full range of what the field is about, rather than bits of pieces of examples given to you. I was able to actually communicate with stakeholders and customers and was given requirements to accomplish tasks that were given to me. The real nice thing was that when communicating to the customers, you get that connection where you have a back and forth with the customer and you can give your advice as well as take it. Projects are never one and done in the real world. There will always be changes to the requirements as well as new rules and restrictions, so you need to always be on your toes when it comes to the project and your customer.

>One thing you don’t really learn in the office is the mechanics behind data structures and algorithms. Either you know them here, or you don’t. The courses I took at SNHU really helped me understand these structures and algorithms. I would never have understood them if it weren’t for these courses as most people at my job don’t know the structures themselves. Most of the work we do involve databases and a bit of software engineering. We develop applications that customer use to access their data and to further understand the data they provide. We take the databases, and create universes and then tables and views in the back-end to make it easier for front-end developers to showcase the work and data provided. I would not have been able to get as far as I did if it weren’t for the wonderful professors I had at SNHU.

>The following three artifacts I had worked on for this portfolio, were all pieces involving languages and functionality I wasn’t as familiar with. I wanted to widen my comfort zone and work in languages I needed more practice in. I wanted to show that I then understood what I have been learning and was able to utilize that more to create something new and exciting to the projects I have worked with in the past.

>During the course, we were asked to perform an in-depth code review on our project that we selected for enhancement.

## Software Design and Engineering Enhancement

>For my first artifact, I have been improving my final project from my CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization course. For that course’s final project, I built a table that can be moved around by the user. By using hotkeys, the user could zoom around and move and rotate the table however they pleased. I took this course during the 19EW6 term. 

>I wanted to include this artifact in my ePortfolio as it was an artifact that used a language I haven’t worked with much in the past and I wanted to get some more practice using C++. I was able to implement previous functions and utilize that to create more features that weren’t required for the final project back in the CS 330 course. I improved the artifact as I expanded its complexity and made the overall application more exciting. 

>I met the course I objectives I planned to meet with this enhancement. I was able to use my skills and techniques to implement design solutions and accomplish the goals I set for myself. I set solutions to solve logic problems in my software as well as notice potential design flaws related to security. 

>I took my previous process involving hotkeys and wanted to have the user change the colorations of the table that they see. I originally planned to have the user press either T for table and L for lighting, but soon realized that I was only able to use the F1-12 keys. I was then thinking, instead of just randomly switching colors, I figured, the user should be able to adjust the amount of red, blue and green that was available. That would be more fun and interactive with the user. I did come to realize that if I kept the code is it was, the user could keep adding more of a singular color and could crash the program. I had to implement a max and min feature to the colors so that the color would stop increasing once the max was hit, and stop decreasing when reaching the minimum. I had to be careful not to let the user affect the application that could completely break my project.

>For my second artifact, I have been improving my final project from my CS 340: Advanced Programming Concepts course. For that course’s final project, we were to create and develop a web service using a software stack and we needed to implement an industry-standard interface. We were to use the RESTful application programming interface (API) web-based protocol and use MongoDB to code and test the uniform resource identifier (URI) paths.  I took this course during the 19EW5 term. 

>I wanted to include this artifact in my ePortfolio as it was an artifact that used a language I never worked with in the past, except for this course. I was able to implement previous functions and utilize them to create more reports that weren’t required for the final project back in the CS 340 course. I improved the artifact as I expanded its complexity.

>I met the course I objectives I planned to meet with this enhancement. I was able to use my skills and techniques to employ iterative testing techniques in my code. I was able to use the software development life cycle to create realistic production schedules for software projects. I was able to create an industry-standard software design. I made sure each function had a clear description if it needed one. I was able to create more robust and efficient code to deliver value and accomplish my industry-specific goals.

>For my third artifact, I have been improving my final project from my DAD 220: Introduction to SQL course. For that course’s final project, we were to create a new database from scratch, consisting of multiple tables. We were then to populate the database, update some records, and delete some existing records as well. We were then also creating queries that applied to previous milestones. 

>I wanted to include this artifact in my ePortfolio as it was an artifact that used a language I never worked with in the past, except for this course. I was able to implement previous functions and utilize them to create more reports that weren’t required for the final project back in the DAD 220 course. I improved the artifact as I expanded its complexity cleaned up the code to make it easier to read. I added more advanced concepts in MySQL. I added a couple users and added user security to those users, granting them specific rights.

>I met the course I objectives I planned to meet with this enhancement. I was able to use my skills and techniques to implement design solutions and accomplish the goals I set for myself. I set solutions to solve logic problems in my software as well as notice potential design flaws related to security. I wanted to ensure that the user could easily take my code and understand everything that they were looking at. I made sure each function had a clear description if it needed one.
